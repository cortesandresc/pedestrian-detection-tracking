## SVM - Matlab
To run the SVM, you need to store the data in '../data/' with the features being saved as 'features.m' and the labels being saved as 'labels.m' where the variable shares the name of the file (i.e. features is named 'features' and is saved in a file named 'features.m'). The function "SVM\_example\_function" shows how to find a set of weights for the data set in "../data/".
